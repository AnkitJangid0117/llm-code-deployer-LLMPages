After Shai restores Ashravan, the world around him shifts subtly but profoundly. No longer haunted by the voices of the past, he begins a new journey—one driven by hope rather than regret. Yet peace is fragile. Shadows of his former life threaten to reemerge, and Ashravan knows that true redemption requires facing truths he's long buried. As he steps into the unknown, he feels a surge of resilience. With each passing day, he rebuilds not just himself, but his purpose—fuelled by memories of friends lost and lessons learned. In a dramatic climax, Ashravan confronts those from his past, embracing his destiny and forging a new legacy from the ashes of destruction and despair, emerging stronger, wiser, and ready to face his future with newfound resolve.
